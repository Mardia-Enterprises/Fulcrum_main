In addition, a new pile supported T-wall was used to provide frontal protection to the Hero Pumping Station. Air suppression on the horizontal pump discharge tubes and butterfly valves on the vertical pump discharge tubes were used on the Hero Pumping Station to prevent backflow. Three 35 -foot and one 60 -foot roller floodgates were required for access through the floodwall for various industrial sites. Numerous utility relocations were necessary to facilitate the flood protection features. The project was broken into two bid packages and engineering during advertising and construction services were provided.",

Design features include earthen levees, pile support concrete T-walls, drainage pumping stations, frontal protection T-walls and valves for the existing drainage pumping stations discharge lines, access roads, and a navigation structure consisting of a 15.5foot by 22.5 -foot vertical lift gate. The three new drainage pumping stations consist of one 300 CFS capacity station and one 500 CFS station made up of vertical axial/mix flow pumps driven by electric motors, and one 500 CFS capacity station made up of vertical pumps driven by diesel engines. In addition to the design, advertising, bidding, construction administration, and resident inspection services were provided. The project was constructed under multiple bid packages.",
