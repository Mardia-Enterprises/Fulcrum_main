      "brief_description": "The Granger Lake Management staff required a new administrative office facility due to the presence of black mold that covered the entire front building walls due to moisture penetration. The design criteria included: a large conference room designed to accommodate up to 80 people while serving as a volunteer room during non-meeting times, a scenic view of Granger Lake from the conference room, increased water pressure from their old facility, and a large grandiose lobby area made to feel like the public was entering a lodge, complete with artifacts, a mammoth pelvis and animal mounts that were found on the Lake property. The client also required that the project schedule be cut by two months in order to facilitate the obligation of Recreational Funds before the end of the 2019 Fiscal Year. The resulting design package was completed before the end of the Federal fiscal year in 2019, and consisted of the development of a construction package for the remediation and demolition of the existing 5,890 SF lake management facility and the design of a new facility across Granger Dam Road from the existing facility. The new facility is one story and was designed for approximately 4,856 SF in gross area. The new construction inclusive of Architectural Services and all other required disciplines (i.e. electrical/mechanical/ fire protection/life safety/civil/structural). Design activities also included the design of landscaping, new paving, paving repairs, and force protection. The new facility houses offices for lake management staff, and a conference room to accommodate up to 60 people with tables and chairs. Site lighting was designed, along with parking for visitors and staff. Additionally, the fencing design required for the government vehicle and equipment compound behind the new office, was designed and included with the construction documents."

      "brief_description": "This $\\$22$d project is to design the update and renovation of Building 373. The dynamometer facility (Bldg 373) at Red River Army Depot is includes areas for rebuild and test and reassembly of the vehicles and equipment. The dynamometers are used to test the engines and transmissions rebuilt in the MSSC shop. Each new engine dynamometer will be served from a new centralized diesel fuel storage and delivery system as well as new centralized oil, ATF and coolant distribution and collection systems. The engine dynamometers will use electrically generated eddy current resistance. Heat rejection from the engines and the dynamometers will be by a new cooling water supply loop and cooling tower. Engine exhaust will be through appropriate new muffler systems in each cell.\nOur team provided project management, multi-discipline A-E Design developing Design-Bid-Build plans, SpecsIntact specifications, design analysis, energy modeling, and coordination of several specialty equipment subconsultants. The MII CWEs were prepared for the $65 \\%, 95 \\%$ and $100 \\%$ design packages. The multidiscipline design team included: \n- Architecture,\n- Civil Engineering\n- Structural Engineering & ATFP Compliance\n- Mechanical Engineering\n- Fueling Design\n- Electrical Engineering\n- Communications Design\n- Landscape Architecture\n- Interior Design/CID/SID\n\n| Project Details |\n| :--: | :--: |\n| Size: 14,000SF |\n| Construction Value: \\$22,000,000 |\n| Total Fee: \\$1,161,820 |\n| Offeror's \\% of Work: 70\\% |\n\nOur team facilitated splitting the project into three construction packages: \n- Building renovation\n- Equipment and installation including process piping systems\n- Selective building demolition, reconstruction, and installation of a new cross-drive transmission dynamometer.\nA feasibility study and cost estimate was prepared comparing the design options for cooling water requirements. The outcome of the study determined the project could accommodate the same cooling system for both new and relocated transmission dynamometers. We prepared design of the heat rejection cooling water loop. \nSustainability and Energy Efficiency: The project followed the UFC 1-200-02 and the Army LEED implementation Guide. The mechanical engineers prepared a energy model and compared final design elements to ensure the HVAC system met ASHRAE 90.1 focusing specifically on the energy efficiency of the large motors and HVAC loads. Other elements to meet LEED and LCCA payback requirements per UFC 3-200-02 were revised such as facility layout, daylighting and lighting controls. Our team prepared the design plans for the new dynamometer equipment, including fluid management and cooling, overhead cranes, and all utilities.\nThe design-bid-build construction package included consideration of all current UFCs, IBC, NFPA, IEEE and the Red River Army Depot Architectural Compatibility and Interior Design Standards. All submittals were coordinated with the government reviewers via Dr. Checks."

      "brief_description": "Our team was tasked by the Galveston District to complete a Value Engineering Study for a 10-year programmatic dredging placement area project along the Houston Ship Channel. This 4-day workshop hosted at the Galveston District Workshop adhered to the USACE Value Standard and the six step Value Engineering job plan as promulgated by SAVE International ${ }^{\\circledR}$.\n\nPlacement Area No. 14 and Placement Area (PA) No. 15 have been in use for the Houston Ship Channel (HSC) and the Bayport Ship Channel for many years. Used yearly in an alternating pattern (Programmatic), these two PAs started out as open bay disposal sites and advanced to upland confined placement zones as the ship channel deepening occurred. At the start of the VE study, plans were underway to combine the two individual placement areas into one large PA.\n\nThe Galveston District area office project goal was to keep the existing alignments, create flow paths to the existing drop-outlet structures, excavate the interior trench into sloped surfaces from higher interior elevations to lowest elevation near the existing discharging pipes.\n\nConstruction Cost:\nTotal Construction Budget for Periodic Dewatering of PA14 and PA15 is approximately $\\$ 9.75$ Million.\nVE Workshop: May 1-4, 2018.\nFacilitated by Ramesh Kalvakaalva, PE, CVS of Neelu Inc, Team Members were provided by MSMM, Neelu Inc and USACE Galveston District. SMEs included: Civil; Hydraulics; Geotechnical; Constructability; Operations; Cost Estimator\nThe VE Workshop adhered to the USACE Value Standard and the six step Value Engineering job plan as promulgated by SAVE International ${ }^{\\circledR}$. This six-step job plan included: I. Information Phase; II. Function Analysis Phase; III. Speculation/Creative Phase; IV. Evaluation Phase; V. Development Phase; VI. Presentation Phase. A FAST Diagram was developed to validate the Scope of the Operations and enable the VE Team to focus on the Functions identified as High Risk.\nThe VE Facilitator and PM also participated in the Implementation Meeting.\n\nObjectives of the VE Study:\n- Get the best return for construction dollars spent (ROI)\n- Assist in bringing the project within budget - consider options for Bid Alternates\n- Assist in identifying the best approach for project delivery\n- Reduce the risks associated with project delivery\n- Minimize Life Cycle Costs for O & M\n- Enhance the project outcome\n- Where costs are reduced, do so without compromising vital functions\n\nPresentation (Examples from Outbrief):\nRECOMMENDATION GT-03\n\nVE Results:\nThe workshop resulted in full development of 17 Design Alternatives (some mutually inclusive) that offered an estimated $\\$ 2$ Million in potential first cost savings to be considered for implementation. There were also 19 Design Suggestions that offer measures to simplify construction, provide various means for reducing costs (in these cases these savings are hard to quantify), may help to improve the operational requirements for the facility, reduce the construction duration, and improve dewatering methods.\n\nImplemented Results:\n7 Design Alternatives were accepted for a net savings of $\\$ 1.75$ Million. All Design Suggestions were flagged for consideration during the Final Design phase of the project.\n\nPrime Firm: MSMM Engineering - Contract W9126G-16-D-0017, Task Order # W9126G18F0159 - Subconsultant - Neelu, Inc."
