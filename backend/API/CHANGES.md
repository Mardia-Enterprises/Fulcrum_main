## Data Format Updates

### Supabase Employee Data Structure
The Supabase adapter has been updated to handle the specific format of resume data as stored in Supabase:
- Employee names are stored in `resume_data.name` (lowercase)
- Employee roles are stored as arrays in `resume_data.role` (lowercase)

### API Changes
- Updated `supabase_adapter.py` to handle the new data format and generate embeddings properly
- Added a `_get_embedding` function to generate embeddings for queries
- Modified `query_index` to return a list of dictionaries with the proper data structure
- Updated all endpoints in `main.py` and `database.py` to process the new data format
- Set a much lower matching threshold (0.01) to ensure more results are returned

### Testing
A test script (`test_query.py`) has been created to directly test the Supabase connection and queries. This script can be used to verify that the API is working correctly.

## Improvements
- The response data could be enhanced to include more fields from the resume_data structure, such as education, years of experience, and relevant projects.
- The match threshold could be customized per endpoint or exposed as a parameter in the API.
- Data consistency could be improved by standardizing the field names and formats when adding new employees.

## Enhanced Response Data

### Complete Resume Data Fields
The API responses have been enhanced to include more complete resume data from Supabase:

- The `EmployeeResponse` model now includes:
  - Full education information (as a formatted string)
  - Years of experience (as returned from Supabase)
  - Complete relevant_projects array with all project details

### Field Processing
- Education fields (which can be arrays in Supabase) are now properly joined into readable strings
- Role fields (which are arrays in Supabase) are properly formatted as comma-separated strings
- All relevant project details are preserved in the API responses, including:
  - Project title and location
  - Fee and cost information
  - Employee's role in the project
  - Project scope

These enhancements ensure that the API returns the complete employee data as stored in Supabase, making it more valuable for client applications.
